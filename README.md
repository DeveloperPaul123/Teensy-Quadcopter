# Teensy-Quadcopter
Teensy based quadcopter project. 

This project is meant for brushed quadcopters (mainly micro drones). My aim is to create a very basic flight controller that doesn't have all the bells and whistles (at first) of more popular controllers but can still perform as well in flight.

Feel free to make pull requests/contribute.
